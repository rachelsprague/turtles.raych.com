## Notes & History

- Established: 2008  
- Water change schedule: 75% bi-weekly
<!-- - Special observations: Likes basking near the sunset; most active at mid-day   -->
<!-- - Future improvements: Consider adding additional floating plants for shade   -->
- I’ve had these gals since they were babies—about the size of a quarter. I got them **20 years ago** and learned a lot along the way. As they grew, I upgraded their space and eventually found this tank on Craigslist. They grew fast… and kept growing.
