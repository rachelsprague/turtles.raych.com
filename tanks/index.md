I currently maintain six aquariums, ranging from plant-only tanks to large turtle setups.  
Each tank has its own ecosystem.

## Tank Overview

### 🐢 Turtle Tank #1
**Type:** Freshwater turtle habitat  
**Volume:** 75 gallons  
**Inhabitants:** Red-eared sliders  
**Focus:** Basking, filtration, long-term care

### 🐠 Guppy Tank #1
**Type:** Heavily planted community tank  
**Volume:** 20 gallons  
**Inhabitants:** Guppies, snails  
**Focus:** Livebearers, plant growth, balance

## Notes & Observations
